# Student-Attentiveness-checker
This project is a real-time student attentiveness detection system designed to assist educators by providing insights into student engagement during virtual or in-person classes. Using computer vision techniques, the system analyzes video streams to monitor key behaviors associated with attentiveness, such as head pose, eye gaze, and facial expressions.
